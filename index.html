                    This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before

                    It lets you create isolated development environments within a 
                    single repository.</p></td>

                    git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. 
                    Combined with the basic Git commands, it’s a way to work on a 
                    particular line of development.</p></td>

                    on tracked files.</p></td>

                    recent commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a 
                    file or omit important information from the commit message.</p></td>

                    installation. You’ll typically only need to use this immediately 
                    after installing Git on a new development machine.</p></td>

                    with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't 
                    try to integrate anything into your local repository. 
                    This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging
